## Python: Drawing Text in Pygame

### Saving Your Work
  
- Upload your project files to your GitHub repo: **drawing-text**

    - **Share the link to your repo on Google Classroom**
    - Make sure your repo is a **public** repo (otherwise I can't see what's in the repo)

### Project Resources

Watch the YouTube video below about drawing text in Pygame.  

Also see the **Drawing Text** section at the end of Chapter 6 (Intro to Graphics) in the *Program Arcade Games* book

- [Displaying Text on The Screen In Pygame](https://youtu.be/ndtFoWWBAoE?feature=shared) (YouTube)


#### Task 1: Update your `main.py` file

- Add the `draw_text()` function discussed in the YouTube video to your `main.py` file
- Call the `draw_text()` function twice, once to draw your first and last name, and a second time to draw the name of your home school (or Career Tech) in your Pygame window

---

#### Task 2: Update your `config.py` file

- In your `config.py` file, define a variable `text_font` as shown in the YouTube video
- When you call your `draw_text()` function, use a color constant from your `config.py` file to set the color of your text

---

#### Task 3: Using the bold and italic arguments with your text_font variable

- As shown in the YouTube video, update your `text_font` variable so that it uses the `SysFont()` function together with the **bold** and *italic* arguments


#### Task 4: Using a True Type Font (.ttf)

- Download the sample True Type Font (.ttf) file into your project folder in VS Code
- As shown in the YouTube video, update your `text_font` variable so that it uses the `Font()` function along with your True Type Font (.ttf) file
- Run your updated script to make sure your name and the name of your school display using the True Type Font you selected
- **Show your finished code and output to your teacher when you are finished**
